# World_Weather_Analysis
 
How might we provide real-time suggestions for our client's ideal hotels? Your first task was to define what you meant by "ideal." So, over the course of the conversation, you narrowed that to hotels that were (1) within a given range of latitude and longitude and that (2) provided the right kind of weather for the client.

* Task: Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide.
* Purpose: PlanMyTrip will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.
* Method: Create a Pandas DataFrame with 500 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process will entail collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data.

Challenge

Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers love it too. And, as with any new product, they’ve recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data you’ve already retrieved in this module. Then, you'll have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of three technical analyses. You will submit the following deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
